# Pre-commit hooks for rangebar-py
# ADR-005: Automated Release Management
#
# Philosophy: Only checks that catch BUGS, not cosmetic formatting
#
# REMOVED (cosmetic, no bug-catching value):
#   - black (Python formatting)
#   - fmt (Rust formatting)
#   - end-of-file-fixer
#   - trailing-whitespace
#
# MOVED TO PRE-PUSH (too slow for commits):
#   - clippy (Rust linting) - runs on `git push` via global hook
#
# Install: pre-commit install
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
